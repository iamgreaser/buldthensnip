If you have a Windows build, running iceball.exe should open the server list.

If you've built this for not-Windows, running ./iceball should do the same.

Software renderer has been dropped as of 0.1.2-11.

The tutorial files are located in pkg/iceball/halp/.

If you can't run the tutorial, or you can't read the text on it,
read docs/troubleshooting.txt.

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
A computer.

BUILDING REQUIREMENTS:
- a C compiler that isn't crap (read: not MSVC++)
  - specifically, GCC
  - MinGW is a port of GCC for Windows: http://mingw.org/
  - Clang works fine for FreeBSD users
  - OS X users: clang is highly recommended
  - if you use something else we might consider compatibility with it
  - learn_more has managed to get this to build with MSVC++ so uh, that could work too.
- SDL 1.2 (not 2.0) - http://libsdl.org/
  - Considering adding SDL 2 support. VideoCore *may* be better than GMA 3150, who knows.
- Lua 5.1 (not 5.2) - http://lua.org/
  - May support 5.2, but will have to break bw/fw compat in order to do that.
- zlib - http://zlib.net/
- sackit - https://github.com/iamgreaser/sackit/
  - you should copy libsackit.a and sackit.h to xlibinc.
- ENet 1.3 - http://enet.bespin.org/
- GNU make
  - if someone has BSD make, please tell us :)

On Windows, read Makefile.mingw for some instructions.
On other OSes, some files for sackit and ENet need to be in xlibinc.

OS X readme:
- install Homebrew and XCode Command-Line Tools
- brew install lua, enet, SDL, glew
- compile sackit from git and copy .a and .so files to /usr/local/lib and sackit.h to /usr/local/include
- make -f Makefile.osx-clang (recommended, Makefile.osx uses GCC)
- to package into a .app, use ./package-osx.sh (brew install dylibbundler first)

MSVC readme (wip):
- create a folder 'winlibs' in the iceball dir
  dump all dll's + lib's in this folder (opengl,lua,zlib, sdl, glew)
  dump all includes in submaps (glew in glew submap, and so on)
  /iceball/
    /winlibs/
	  /glew/
	  /lua/
	  /SDL/
	  /zlib/
	  glew32.lib
	  glew32.dll
	  lua5.1.lib
	  lua5.1.dll
	  and so on..

- right mouse on project -> properties.
  Working directory (without quotes): '$(SolutionDir)/../'
  Command Arguments (without quotes):
	'-c iceballga.me 20737'  (connect to srv) (Note, relevant address is dead)
	'-s 0 pkg/base' (make local srv)
- edit clsave/pub/user.json
- now run it from vs.net debugger :)

for the git starters:
- git update-index --assume-unchanged clsave\pub\user.json

and to get updates from the main repo:
- git remote add upstream git://github.com/iamgreaser/iceball.git
- git pull --rebase upstream master
- git push origin master
