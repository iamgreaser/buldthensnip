		This file contains configuration for the engine itself.
		It cannot be read by any mods.

		If you have a graphics card that's reasonably fast
		and has at least 128MB of VRAM (64MB *might* cut it),
		set gl_vbo to true.
		(Yes, this DOES help on an Intel 3000 HD.)
		If your game crashes when the map starts appearing, set it to false.

		If you have an OpenGL-2.0-capable card (or one with non-power-of-two support),
		and you wish to conserve a little bit of VRAM,
		set gl_expand_textures to false.
		If you get white boxes, it obviously wasn't capable - set it to true.
