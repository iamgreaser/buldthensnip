### INCOMPLETE. Hopefully will apply eventually. ###

Congratulations for successfully extracting Iceball from its archive!
I'm assuming you did that, right?
If you're running it from within the archive, extract the damn thing NOW.
(It won't work otherwise.)

Anyhow, if this manual isn't clear enough, please inform us somehow!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRAMMERS, TAKE NOTE: Please don't make server launchers.

I want there to be a minimum barrier to entry which requires that people read
this text file here which you are reading right now.

While on the topic of stuff to not make...
If you have a hack for this game, PLEASE DON'T RELEASE IT.

Releasing hacks means that people a shitload dumber than yourself are using the
stuff you made, and they'll say "thank you" once, then immediately forget about
you and say "i'm so awesome and my penis is huge" many, many more times.

A good deterrent is to look at mpgh.net, and watching all the all-lower-case
zero-punctuation posts which have been repeated countless times throughout the
whole forums. Just look at a thread and you can feel your IQ being sapped out
of you. Yes, MPGH really is bad enough to lower your IQ just by READING it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, the first thing you will need to know is how to use the commandline.
If you don't know THAT, here's a quick guide:

Stuff on the commandline takes the form:
  command argument argument "argument with spaces in it" argument
If the command you're running has no arguments,
you can run it like so:
On MS-DOS systems, like Windows:
  cls
On UNIX based systems, like Linux:
  clear

Basically, the only built-in command you'll need is "cd".
Let's say you were dropped into where you extracted Iceball to on startup,
and you want to go to the pkg/base/pmf folder,
you would do this:
MS-DOS:
  cd pkg\base\pmf
UNIX:
  cd pkg/base/pmf

If for some reason you extracted Iceball to C:\Program Files\Iceball,
and you got dropped into some random location on, say, the D: drive,
you would do this:
  c:
  cd "\Program Files\Iceball"

I'm assuming people using UNIX based systems can work out how it works on
their system. (Also, typing some of something then pressing TAB helps, too,
at least for those of you who are using bash as your shell.)

If you would like to know more about how to use the command line,
use a search engine.

UNIX users: "man" is a great program. Try "man ls", for instance.
Note, for shell builtins, you might want to try e.g. "help cd".

Anyhow, with that sorted, and assuming you're in the Iceball directory now,
type this into the commandline for help:
MS-DOS:
  iceball
UNIX:
  ./iceball

You should be fine from there.

NOTE: On Windows, you will need to check stderr.txt for the help you need.
I haven't worked out how to make SDL *NOT* do this stupid crap yet.

By the way, here's a tip for the Windows users:

Double-click opencmd.bat. It should get you into the right directory.

If you have any questions, use your preferred search engine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a Windows build and it crashes on you under all circumstances,
CHECK IF YOUR CPU SUPPORTS SSE2.

If it doesn't, it'll be too slow anyway.

(All x86_64 CPUs support SSE2 as a minimum requirement.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we're on the topic of Windows builds, check if you have a pkg/ folder.
If you don't have one, you cannot run a server.
(Go pull the latest pkg/ folder from github. DO IT.)

Once you've set your nickname in clsave/pub/user.json,
set your nickname in clsave/pub/user.json,
remember to set your nickname in clsave/pub/user.json,
look for any connect-*.bat files,
and set your nickname in clsave/pub/user.json.

Oh, and then after you set your nickname in clsave/pub/user.json,
you can run said connect-*.bat file,
having set your nickname in clsave/pub/user.json.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iceball refers to one of two things:
- The game engine.
- The base game itself ("Ice Lua Components"), currently located in pkg/base.

If you wish to screw with the base game, check docs/modding_101.txt.

It's advised that you don't screw with the engine, though,
unless you wish to improve the mainline engine,
in which case you should prod me (GreaseMonkey) on IRC, 
#AoS @ QuakeNet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the default keys. MAKE A NOTE OF THEM.

W A S D = move/strafe
space = jump
left ctrl = crouch
V = sneak

1 2 3 4 = select tool
arrow keys = select block colour
R = reload gun

M = show map

T = chat ("talk")
Y = teamchat
/ = command

ESC = quit game
F5 = release mouse cursor
F1 = show some debug information

TAB = show names / scores
, = switch teams

Note that there is no weapon select key. This isn't Ace of Jagex.

For each tool, here is what each mouse button does:
  1:   Spade: L = break 1 block, R = dig 3 blocks
  2:   Block: L = place a block, R = sample block colour
  3:     Gun: L = shoot, R = zoom
  4: Grenade: L press = pull the pin, L release = throw

A few notes:
- If you left-click-dig with the spade, you can get blocks back which you can
  build stuff with later.
- Holding the grenade longer does not make it travel further.
  If you want that to happen, try jumping.
- Going to your team's tent ( marked with a + on the map ) allows you to get
  more blocks and grenades.
  - You really should do this instead of just mining through everything.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You MUST edit your config to start with.
[ TODO: this will eventually be true! ]

See docs/setup_json.txt for more information.

There is at least one thing you'll need to do;
  otherwise you will NOT be able to play!

MinGW Install Help

(This isn't 100% complete or guaranteed to work yet.)

Dependencies:

http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.5.tar.gz
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz
http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.7.tar.gz

Download each one and extract outside of /buldthensnip (which we will call $ICEBALL)
For each dependency cd to the root path and follow the listed commands.

TODO: change these so they work with MS-DOS "copy", w/o requiring MSYS.

zlib:

make -f win32/Makefile.gcc
cp *.h $ICEBALL/winlibs
cp *.a $ICEBALL/winlibs
cp *.dll $ICEBALL/winlibs

lua:

Final build (from MINGW32)

# unoptimized build
make clean all -f Makefile.mingw
# optimized with SSE2
make clean all -f Makefile.mingw CC=gcc CFLAGS_EXTRA="-msse2 -mfpmath=sse"

You may find that it's not correctly pointing at gcc.exe in which case you can copy the file or change the Makefile.
