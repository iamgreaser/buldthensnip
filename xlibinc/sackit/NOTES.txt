# STUFF THAT CAN WRECK THE MIXER
#

IT203 changelog states:
	Interpolated mixing options.

IT203-IT210 driver info has lots of good stuff:
	Disk Writer
	
	This WAV file writer is NOT available for public distribution.
	Contact me if you wish to obtain this - it will NOT be made
	available without some sort of (monetary) agreement.
	
	Details
	* 16 bit Stereo/Mono output
	* 22kHz to 64kHz output frequency
	* 16 bit interpolation (65536x 'oversampling')
	* 32 bit mixing
	* Software volume ramping (set at 500th of a second or less)
	
	The disk writer also uses volumes ranging between 0 and 32768
	instead of 0 to 128.

IT204 changelog states:
	To all mixed devices which supported interpolation, some samples
	could have caused errors.
	<ZaStaR>

IT206 is the first version with a PUBLIC ITWAV.DRV.
It spits out a RAW file.
(It's available in the PAID version of IT203.)

IT211 changelog states:
	The ITWAV.DRV file now writes proper .WAV files instead of .RAW

^ This is probably the easiest to get working accurately that actually spits out a .wav.

IT212 changelog states:
	Inserted a new algorithm into the direct-to-disk writer to remove
	clicks at the end of samples in cases of Note Cut commands, Note Cut NNA
	and instantaneous sample changes in sample mode. For those who have
	sent me money and would like to receive the upgrade, EMail me.

IT213 changelog states:
	Direct to Disk writer now uses logarithmic volume ramping
	and quadratic spline interpolation

IT214 changelog states:
	Diskwriter interpolation changed from quadratic spline
	to cubic spline. (Requires a FPU)

IT214 patch 3 changelog states:
	Driver news: Updated driver format (incompatible with previous ITs)
		Resonant filters - check FILTERS.TXT for information.
		This stuff has been released basically so that contributors
		can distribute their songs that use filters..
	MMX drivers implemented.
	WAV driver - time accuracy improved
		- can specify destination directory (on shift-F5)
		- handles resonant filters
IT214 patch 4 changelog states:
	4-band EQ in diskwriter

List of things that'll piss me off, by version:
IT206:
	Volume ramping. At least we have a number here :)
	Oversampling, perhaps?

# DIFFS FROM IT211
#

Currently going with IT211.
Stuff that might screw us up:
IT212:
  - Bug fix: Default sample pan will override instrument pan whether "Old
             Effects" is on or off. [IRRELEVANT, SEE IT213 BELOW]

  - Soundcard Driver news
    - Inserted a new algorithm into the direct-to-disk writer to remove
      clicks at the end of samples in cases of Note Cut commands, Note Cut NNA
      and instantaneous sample changes in sample mode. For those who have
      sent me money and would like to receive the upgrade, EMail me.

IT213:
  - Modification: Sample panning reset to override instrument panning due to
                  demand.

  - Update: Several miscellaneous changes

  - Update: If old effects is *ON*, then a looped volume envelope will NOT
            include the last node (for XM compat)

  - Automatic MIDI Pitch wheel handling. Vibrato, pitch slides, portamentos
    all handled.
    <Note: REQUIRES a FPU.. the program will hang if you enable this on
           Shift-F1 and you don't have a FPU (486DX+ chips have FPUs)>

  - MIDI Configuration can be embedded into .IT files.
    (Option is on Shift-F1)

IT214:
  - Driver news: Diskwriter interpolation changed from quadratic spline
                 to cubic spline. (Requires a FPU)

IT214 Patch 1:
  - Bug fix: Volume envelopes were skipping some ticks (sounded too fast)
  - Bug fix: Slight problems with the wav writer fixed
  - Other miscellaneous fixups

IT214 Patch 2:
  - Bug fix: MIDI Macros (unparameterised) were somehow disabled somewhere
             after IT212.. now reenabled

IT214 Patch 3:
  - Driver news: Updated driver format (incompatible with previous ITs)
                 Resonant filters - check FILTERS.TXT for information.
                 This stuff has been released basically so that contributors
                 can distribute their songs that use filters..
    - MMX drivers implemented.
    - WAV driver - time accuracy improved
                 - handles resonant filters

IT214 Patch 4:
  - Bug fix: SCx and Qxx commands and will work with MIDI Out instruments

  - Driver news: 4-band EQ in diskwriter
                 Minor miscellaneous upgrades
                 Fixes to MMX drivers that clicked on 0 volume (oops)

IT214 Patch 5:
  - Rewrite of all MMX routines for stability when networked. Non MMX drivers
    have not been changed.

#
#
#
From ITTECH.TXT:
	Bit 5: On = Link Effect G's memory with Effect E/F. Also
		Gxx with an instrument present will cause the
		envelopes to be retriggered. If you change a
		sample on a row with Gxx, it'll adjust the
		frequency of the current note according to:

		NewFrequency = OldFrequency * NewC5 / OldC5;

This is complete bullshit - the sample just doesn't change.
Suprising how such an accurate document has such a big mistake in it.
(No really, ITTECH.TXT is suprisingly accurate.)
